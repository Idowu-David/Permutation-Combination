## PERMUTATION_COMBINATION PROGRAM
### This Program calculates the permutation or number of times for which r objects can be picked from n
### It calculates the permutation of objects using the permutation formula, given n and r
### r is the number of times or arrangement that can be gotten from the n object
### nPr = n!/(n-r)!
### It also calculates the combination of objects using the combination formula, given n and r
### nCr = nPr/r!
